## What's next?

You've done fantastically well exploring the Video Sensing block and conditions!

There are other loads of Scratch games which use conditions to gauge user interaction. They include:
[Chatbot](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/chatbot){:target="_blank"}.
[Brain game](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/brain-game){:target="_blank"}.

Here are some other [projects which use Scratch's Video Sensing block](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/201435){:target="_blank"}.

Why not use the Video Sensing block as a movement detection to create a musical statues game for a friend to play?
