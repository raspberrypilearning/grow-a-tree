## What next?

In this project, you have:
+ Used the `Video Sensing`{:class="block3extensions"} extension blocks to detect a user's movement
+ Used selection — `if ... then`{:class="block3control"} and `if ... then ... else`{:class="block3control"} — to grow or shrink the tree, and to tell the player when they have won the game

Next, you could try one of our other Scratch games, such as [Chatbot](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/chatbot){:target="_blank"} and [Brain game](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/brain-game){:target="_blank"}, which use conditions to create user interaction.

Here are some other [projects that use the Scratch Video Sensing extension](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/201435){:target="_blank"}.

Why not use the `Video Sensing`{:class="block3extensions"} extension blocks to create another game involving movement detection, such as solo musical statues, for a friend to play?

Otherwise, you could explore two other extensions, `Translate`{:class="block3extensions"} and `Text to Speech`{:class="block3extensions"}, in another Starter project, [How are you?](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/how-are-you){:target="_blank"}
