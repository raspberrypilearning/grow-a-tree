## What next?

You've done fantastically well exploring the Video Sensing block and conditions!

There are other loads of Scratch games such as [Chatbot](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/chatbot){:target="_blank"} and [Brain game](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/brain-game){:target="_blank"} which use conditions to create user interaction.

Here are some other [projects which use Scratch's Video Sensing block](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/201435){:target="_blank"}.

Why not use the Video Sensing block as a movement detection to create a game of solo musical statues for a friend to play?

Or you could explore two other Extension blocks `Translate`{:class="block3extensions"} and `Text to Speech`{:class="block3extensions"} in another Starter project [How are you?](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/how-are-you){:target="_blank"}
