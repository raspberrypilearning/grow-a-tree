## Set the tree

First we have to set the scene, get the tree planted and steer the player with opening instructions.

--- task ---

+ Open the code editor. The tree is planted at x: 0 and y: -160. Feel free to plant it in a new position. 

+ The tree is scaled to 10% of the size of the original tree image. You can alter % for a bigger or smaller starting size.

```blocks3
```
+ Notice you need to select the language twice and paste your message in twice in order to create both spoken and written translation.

+ Next we need to let the player know how to play the game! The instructions currently day "Keep still to grow the tree. Top tip - it helps to lean on your hands." That's a bit dull - why not jazz up the instructions?

```blocks3
say ( translate [How are things going in Palenstine?] to (Arabic v) ::translate ) for (4) seconds
```
+ If you like, change the tone of the voice so it  represents you.
```blocks3
set voice to [tenor v] ::tts
```

## Change your sprite

![Access You](images/you.png)

As the message is from you, why not make sure the sprite looks a bit like you? It will then appear that youâ€™re the one speaking and typing the message!

--- task ---
+ Go to Costumes. Select, by highlighting, one of the ten cosutmes available. The sprite should have automatically changed.

+ Run the program to see and hear yourself speaking another langauge. Impressive!
